Stock Price Predictor: Advanced LSTM Model with RNN

Project Overview:

This repository showcases a cutting-edge stock price prediction model, for any stock needs to be available on Yahoo Finance. Harnessing the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, this project exemplifies a sophisticated approach to time series forecasting in the dynamic realm of stock markets.

Our model leverages 20 years of historical stock data, employing advanced preprocessing techniques including moving averages and technical indicators. The multi-layer LSTM architecture, enhanced with dropout layers, demonstrates remarkable predictive capabilities, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of just 7.49% and an impressive R-squared value of 0.9317.

Key Features and Technical Highlights:

- Robust Data Acquisition: Utilizes yfinance for comprehensive historical data retrieval.
- Advanced Preprocessing: Implements moving averages, technical indicators, and normalization.
- Sophisticated LSTM Architecture**: Features multi-layer LSTM with dropout for superior generalization.
- Adaptive Learning: Incorporates learning rate scheduling and early stopping mechanisms.
- Comprehensive Visualization: Offers intuitive tools for data and prediction result interpretation.
- Streamlit integrated web app for anny stock data prediction.

Performance Metrics:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0416
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 0.0482
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 7.49%
- R-squared: 0.9317

These metrics underscore the model's exceptional accuracy in predicting stock prices, positioning it as a valuable tool for financial analysis and algorithmic trading strategies.

Potential Applications and Adaptability:

While optimized for Google stock, this model's architecture is inherently adaptable. It serves as an excellent foundation for:
- Financial analysts seeking data-driven insights
- Algorithmic traders developing sophisticated trading strategies
- Data scientists exploring advanced time series prediction techniques

The project's modular design facilitates easy adaptation to other stocks or financial instruments, broadening its applicability across various financial markets.

Educational Value and Ethical Considerations:

This project stands as an educational resource, demonstrating the application of deep learning in financial forecasting. It provides hands-on experience with TensorFlow, Keras, and advanced time series analysis techniques.

DISCLAIMER: Users should approach stock market prediction with caution. The model's performance, while impressive, does not guarantee future results. It should be used as one of many tools in a comprehensive financial analysis toolkit, not as a standalone decision-making system.
